# A Musical Guide to Phase Vocoders

Introduction
=====================

A Github repository with Max 7 code and the Latex files. The code contains examples about the construction of a Phase Vocoder as well as musical implementation. In the text one can find a guide for phase vocoders, propositions and examples for artisting uses of the tool. Last but not least, a musical piece exploring the artistic capacities of the phase vocoder.


This is the work of my Master's Dissertation for Paris 8 University during my studies from October 2017 to October 2019. It focuses on the concept of the phase vocoder in a more artistic context.

Software Details
=====================

This project's code is realized in Max 7 and Java script.



How to deploy the Code
=====================

This project's code is divised into two folders. The first folder contains tutorials and introductory builds of spectral analysis and phase vocoders. The second contains artistic uses of the phase vocoder some including jitter.
