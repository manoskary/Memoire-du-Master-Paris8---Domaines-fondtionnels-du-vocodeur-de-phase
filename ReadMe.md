# A Musical Guide to Phase Vocoders

Introduction
=====================

A Github repository with Max 7 code and the Latex files. The code contains examples about the construction of a Phase Vocoder as well as musical implementation. In the text one can find a guide for phase vocoders, propositions and examples for artisting uses of the tool. Last but not least, a musical piece exploring the artistic capacities of the phase vocoder.


This is the work of my Master's Dissertation for Paris 8 University during my studies from October 2017 to October 2019. It focuses on the concept of the phase vocoder in a more artistic context.

Software Details
=====================

This project's code is realized in Max version 7.0.3 with some Javascript code. The text is writen in Latex code.

How to deploy the Code
=====================

This project's code is divised into three folders : 

- The first folder called "Frequency Tracking" contains tutorials and introductory builds of pitch tracking using spectral analysis

- The second folder called "Phase Vocoders" contains introductory build of phase vocoders. In general a phase vocoder is divised in two paches one for user the operational patch and one for the PFFT object containing the actual phase vocoder.


- The last folder called "Visual Effects" included artistic uses of the phase vocoder concept using jitter.

The most important patch is the "First Morphing Try" containing a Super phase vocoder as described in the dissertation.


Find your way in the Repository
=====================

The repository consists of 4 folders containing :

- The dissertation writen in english

- The disseration writeen in french

- Sound samples and the electracoustic piece "Diakrotima"

- The developped code
